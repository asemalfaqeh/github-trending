Design architecture
Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is a software design pattern that is structured to separate program logic and user interface controls.

#Android Tech Stack
 
 - #RxJava2
   I use RxJava2 to handle threading and asynchronous operations, 
   and I use RxView to handling UI events,to binding observables to UI components, such as buttons or text fields.

 - #Retrofit:
   Retrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java, developed by Square. 
   I use this library to making network requests, by providing a clean and easy-to-use API for defining 
   endpoints and handling responses and retrofit uses annotations to describe the structure of an API and automatically
   generates the necessary code for making network requests. this makes it easier to write code that is easily readable

 - #Glide
   Glide is an open-source image loading library for Android. I use It to provides an easy-to-use and efficient way to load and display images,
   especially for mobile devices. 
   Glide uses disk cache to reduce the memory overhead of loading images and to improve the performance of loading images.
